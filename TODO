TODO
----

[ ] distclean doesn't work without a config
[ ] Every driver should have a remove function
[ ] Clean up make system. Currently I think there are many things from the linux make
    system which are not needed for U-Boot.
[ ] get/set for nonextisting parameters crashes
[ ] There is a xmalloc function which panics when out of memory. Use this function
    where we don't want to check for oom. Same applies to strdup/xstrdup.
[ ] cleanup common.h. There are far too many things in it where we better have a seperate
    header file.
[ ] Rewrite network stack. The one-loop-for-all-protocols stack is just too ugly and
    big and uses thousands of global variables. Identify common functions and make
    a loop per network protocol
[-] Cleanup cpu/*. Many functions there are not cpu specific. For example the cache
    functions for arm are common for most arm processors. (done for ARM)
[ ] Implement a info command for malloced space. Use it to find memory holes.
[ ] Board support should go to arch/*/boards/*
[ ] Move SoC specific header files from include/ to include/asm/arch/
[ ] The header files in include/asm-linux/ are i386 specific. Make it work on your
    i-Book (bigendian...)
[ ] Globbing support? Might be too expensive, but on the other hand, if you have the
    space, why not?
[ ] Implement protect/unprotect support for cfi devices.
[ ] patch hush.c so that you can get/set device parameters with dev.param= and remove
    get/set applets
[ ] Implement a command 'countdown' or similar. It should delay the boot process and
    interrupt it if a certain string is received. The string could be any key, ctrl-c
    or a certain string. Maybe like this:
    countdown -m msg -t timeout -x [ctrl-c|anykey|string]
    If done, remove the corresponding stuff from common/main.c
[ ] Several .c/.h files do not have GNU/copyright headers.
[ ] The cramfs driver currently uses direct memory accesses instead of read(). This disqualifies it
    for real block devices.
[ ] Add documentation for:
	[ ] driver model
	[ ] device parameter
	[ ] big picture
[ ] realloc seems to crash without further notice when out of memory.

DONE
----

[x] Rename vmlinux -> u-boot
[x] Implement current work directory
[x] ARCH=linux should catch ctrl-c
[x] Implement 'rm'
[x] the mount command currently does not accept a full path (i.e. /dev/nor0) but
    only a device id string (nor0). This sucks.
[x] FS support is not optional eventhough the Kconfig system claims it.
[x] U-Boot used to have support for different consoles. The old code was huge and
    ineffective, so I removed it. Reimplement it using the driver model.
[x] Mount without options should show mounted filesystems
[x] Add/fix help texts for commands
[x] mw is broken. Add common option parsing for mm/md
