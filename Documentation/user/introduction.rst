Introduction
============

This is the barebox user manual. It describes how to configure, compile
and run barebox on Embedded Systems.

barebox (just barebox, not *the* barebox) is a bootloader designed for
Embedded Systems. It runs on a variety of ARM, MIPS, PowerPC based SoCs.
barebox aims to be a versatile and flexible bootloader, not only for
booting Embedded Linux Systems but also for initial hardware bringup and
development. barebox is highly configurable to be suitable as a full featured
development binary to a lean production system. Just like busybox is the swiss
army knife for Embedded Linux, barebox is the swiss army knife for bare metal,
hence the name.
