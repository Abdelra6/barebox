		 * Address line test
		 *
		 * Description: Test the address bus wiring in a
		 *              memory region by performing a walking
		 *              1's test on the relevant bits of the
		 *              address and checking for aliasing.
		 *              This test will find single-bit
		 *              address failures such as stuck -high,
		 *              stuck-low, and shorted pins. The base
		 *              address and size of the region are
		 *              selected by the caller.
		 *
		 * Notes:	For best results, the selected base
		 *              address should have enough LSB 0's to
		 *              guarantee single address bit changes.
		 *              For example, to test a 64-Kbyte
		 *              region, select a base address on a
		 *              64-Kbyte boundary. Also, select the
		 *              region size as a power-of-two if at
		 *              all possible.
		 *
		 * Returns:     0 if the test succeeds, 1 if the test fails.
		 *
		 * ## NOTE ##	Be sure to specify start and end
		 *              addresses such that addr_mask has
		 *              lots of bits set. For example an
		 *              address range of 01000000 02000000 is
		 *              bad while a range of 01000000
		 *              01ffffff is perfect.
