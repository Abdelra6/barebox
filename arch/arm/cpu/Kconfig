	  The ARM920T is licensed to be produced by numerous vendors,
	  and is used in the Maverick EP9312 and the Samsung S3C2410.

	  More information on the Maverick EP9312 at
	  <http://linuxdevices.com/products/PD2382866068.html>.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM920T processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.


# ARM926T
config CPU_ARM926T
	bool
	select CPU_32v5
	help
	  This is a variant of the ARM920.  It has slightly different
	  instruction sequences for cache and TLB operations.  Curiously,
	  there is no documentation on it at the ARM corporate website.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM926T processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.

# Figure out what processor architecture version we should be using.
# This defines the compiler instruction set which depends on the machine type.
