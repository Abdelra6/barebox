	  This enables compilation of a generic image that can be started 2nd
	  stage from qemu, barebox, or other bootloaders. It picks up a device
	  tree passed by the Linux kernel's boot convention for the given
	  architecture and thus can be used anywhere that a Kernel image could be used.
	  The image will be called images/barebox-dt-2nd.img
