config MTD_DATAFLASH
	tristate "Support for AT45xxx DataFlash"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  This enables access to AT45xxx DataFlash chips, using SPI.
	  Sometimes DataFlash chips are packaged inside MMC-format
	  cards; at this writing, the MMC stack won't handle those.

config MTD_DATAFLASH_WRITE_VERIFY
	bool "Verify DataFlash page writes"
	depends on MTD_DATAFLASH
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash.
	  It may help if you are verifying chip setup (timings etc) on
	  your board.  There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_DOCG3
	bool "M-Systems Disk-On-Chip G3"
	select BCH
	select BITREV
	---help---
	  This provides an MTD device driver for the M-Systems DiskOnChip
	  G3 devices.

	  The driver provides access to G3 DiskOnChip, distributed by
	  M-Systems and now Sandisk. The support is very experimental,
	  and doesn't give access to any write operations.
