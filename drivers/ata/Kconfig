config DISK_DRIVE
	bool "Generic disk drives"
	help
	  Add support for generic disk drives. Common behaviour for this kind
	  of devices is using a partition table in the first sector. Say Y here
	  if you intend to work with disk drives (also CF cards and SD cards).

config DISK_BIOS
	bool "BIOS based"
	select DISK_DRIVE
	depends on X86_BIOS_BRINGUP
	help
	  Gain disk drive access via int13 calls to the standard PC-BIOS.
	  The advantage of this driver is, it still uses user's defined boot
	  media to work on. Disadvantage is: Due to its 16 bit nature it is
	  slow.
